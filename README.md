## Description

_This is the final build of Doctor Hunter, an app that allows you to search for registered doctors in your local area_

## App Specifications & Development Details

_This part of the README is designed to help both the user and I to understand the kind of application I'm developing, the development process, and what still needs to be implemented (and how I will implement them) based on certain guidelines_


### Development Schedule
